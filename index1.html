<h2> Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
<p>Technology is very important in business operations. No matter how large your business is, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and satisfy your customers by giving them what they demand. Technology affects the efficiency and relationships of your business and also affects the security of confidential information. [1]</p>

<h2>Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h2>
<p>A digital project is a product developed and delivered digitally which can be almost anything, a software application, an online campaign or a website. A good Project Manager will be able to select and execute the right project management method for your team and type of project, but no matter the choice of methodology, most digital projects go through the same 5-steps.

<h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT.</h2>
<p>I plan and carry out tasks with the help of an unto date to-do list, this is a list of all the tasks that I need to complete with the most important task at the top of the list and least important at the bottom. By using a list like this I have all my tasks written down so I will not forget anything important and I can plan the order in which I complete them so I can tell what needs doing and what I can complete later.

<h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
<p>There are many types of risks of concern to projects, these risks can result in unwanted expenses and performance problems for you and your organisation. For example governance risk relates to board and management performance with regard to ethics, community stewardship, and company reputation. Another risk is choosing a technology that can’t be made to work which will cause errors with your project, also with the advancements of technology you will have to keep updated on the new programmes or buy completely new technology.

<h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h2>
<p>Choosing software for your project is not an easy process, many people know that they will need a new system but can be put off because of competing products, fear of choosing the wrong thing or they don’t have enough time. If you don’t have the resources to spare it is very important to get it right the first time. If I want to make a good decision when choosing new IT systems and software I will follow these 7 steps.

        <li>Know your objective.</li>
        <li>Create a list of software requirements.</li>
        <li>Start researching for relevent applications.</li>

        <li>Start trialling your selected software.</li>
        <li>Do your due diligence.</li>
        <li>Start negotiating.</li>

<h2>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
<p>I have used many different technologies to achieve my goals, like Trello to help me organise my tasks and complete them in order. For the coding part of my project I used visual studio code which is a priority as it is used for the design and content for the website. I also used pages to keep notes of my answers to the questions that i researched using google and other websites. I used Github to save and upload my work so others can share it and update it, I use Github because it stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better.</p>

<h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h2>
<p>The internet is the main source of information and entertainment, but it is important to realise the number of restrictions on what you can do and cannot do online. There are legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and videos. Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file can be copied or converted to another format. When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it, you do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it but some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.

<button class="accordion">2.1.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h2>
    <p>The tools I have used to create my website have been crucial in developing it. For example, for the design and content of my project were created using visual studio code which makes it capable of being changed when I need to update it. Also by using Trello I can work at my own pace and it helps keep me organised and working to my schedule.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">2.2.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h2>
    <p> Without the tools I used to create my website I wouldn’t be as successful in my project for example, if I didn’t use GitHub I would have lost all my work. With trello I could keep up to date with my tasks and visual studio code is the main part of my project so these tools are appropriate. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">2.3.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h2>
    <p>My websites strength is that it is very easy to use and to read, also it is nice to look at. However I would like to use links and animations but since I am an amateur I still have a lot to learn. Overall I am happy with my website as it is my first work using new tools and I got to learn a lot so I’m exited to learn more.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">2.4.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
    <p>Improvements I would add to my website are more links and animations. Also I would like visitors to be able to jump across the page without scrolling and have the background picture scroll down with the user instead of being fixed and repeated.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">2.5.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
    <p>The purpose of my website is to show what I have learned and to answer questions. I believe my website has done this as it is eye-catching and full of information easy to understand but there are somethings about it I could have made better for example, I could add an animation in the background instead of the still image.</p>

<button class="accordion">3.1.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
    <p>The benefits of using IT and systems is that it helps you find mistakes and identify problems, also it enables you to make gradual changes to maximise your productivity. However, rapid changes in technology can cause systems and tools can become outdated meaning you will need upgrades or replacements.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">3.2.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
    <p>There are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency like you could track and limit how much time you’re spending on projects and take regular breaks. Also you can quit multitasking as attempting to do several tasks at once can result in loss of time and productivity, instead just focus on one task at a time.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">3.3.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
    <p>Next time I start a project I will make full use of Trello to plan my project step by step and I will also give up on trying to make it perfect and do it to the best of my ability and make changes when necessary to improve it as I can always come back to it and adjust it.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">3.4.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
    <p>I would test digital solutions by comparing it to my previous work, also I could have a team member inspect the work and get a second opinion, I can also have testers check the project for bugs and other problems. Also I could use a digital testing service like sogetti and have a thourough check on my project.</p>

<div class="panel">
    <h2>Describe the content and layout for each page.</h2>
    <p>The layout and content of my project is designed to be able to read and to be nice to look at. I have used accordion drop boxes to make it easier to read what section it was you wanted to read, And the background was used to make the page seem more peaceful.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">1.5.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
    <p>Copyright and other laws affect websites because it may restrict what you publish, websites fall under this protection because they contain creative elements like written content and images. First you will need to get permission if you want to publish information on your website from another site. Secondly, use your own photographs or pictures you created as they are your own property.</p>

    <h2>Describe access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
    <p>There are many issues that can affect people with disabilities when accessing a webpage, like if someone has a hearing disability but the webpage has audio in it. This can be overcome by adding subtitles on the page or by removing the audio and replace it with something else.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">1.7.</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2>Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites.</h2>
    <p>When you are viewing a website you will find many different file types, most are common to a lot of websites, while others are more obscure and require specialists to use. Here are a list of the most appropriate and common file types: .CSS, .DOC, .HTML, .JPEG.</p>
