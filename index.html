<h1>Unit 1, outcome1.</h1>
    </div>
<div>
<h2>1.0. About me.</h2>
<p>I joined codenation because I wanted to learn something new and useful. I am interested in making a career in IT because I needed a change from warehouse work and because I use technology everyday so this seemed like the right choice. Since joining I have learned a lot and it was difficult at first, but after a while you get used to it and you can create many wonderful things which I am very exited about doing.</p></div>
<div>
<h2>1.1. Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
<p>Technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages. [1]</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>1.2. Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h2>
<p>Managing digital projects. What is a digital project? Digital projects are products which are developed and delivered digitally. Nowadays, it can be almost anything. A software application, a website, an online campaign, etc. What is true for digital projects is that they're virtual products delivered as a service to the client.
    A good Project Manager will be able to select and execute the right project management method for your team and type of project, but no matter the choice of methodology, most digital projects go through the same 5-steps. [2]
<ol>
    <li>Scoping</li>
    <li>Planning</li>
    <li>Development</li>
    <li>Testing & Deployment</li>
    <li>Maintenance</li>
</ol></p></div>
<div>
<h2>1.3. Plan and carry out tasks using IT.</h2>
<p>All of these are symptoms of not keeping a proper "To-Do List." These are prioritised lists of all the tasks that you need to carry out. They list everything that you have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom.By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything important. And by prioritising tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what you can leave until later.To-Do Lists are essential if you're going to beat work overload. When you don't use them effectively, you'll appear unfocused and unreliable to the people around you. [3]

</p></div>
<div>
<h2>1.4. Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
<p>There are many other types of risks of concern to projects. These risks can result in cost, schedule, or performance problems and create other types of adverse consequences for the organisation. For example:
    <ul>
        <li>Governance risk relates to board and management performance with regard to ethics, community stewardship, and company reputation.</li>
        <li>Strategic risks result from errors in strategy, such as choosing a technology that can’t be made to work.</li>
        <li>Operational risk includes risks from poor implementation and process problems such as procurement, production, and distribution.</li>
        <li>Market risks include competition, foreign exchange, commodity markets, and interest rate risk, as well as liquidity and credit risks.</li>
        <li>Legal risks arise from legal and regulatory obligations, including contract risks and litigation brought against the organisation.</li>
        <li>Risks associated with external hazards, including storms, floods, and earthquakes; vandalism, sabotage, and terrorism; labor strikes; and civil unrest. [4]</li>
    </ul>
</p></div>
<div>
<h2>1.5. Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h2>
<p>Choosing software is not a quick or easy process. Many small business owners and managers know they need a new system but are put off by the number of competing products, the amount of time needed to evaluate each one, or a fear of choosing the wrong solution. We know you can’t afford to make a mistake, in small businesses we just don’t have resources to spare, so it’s important to get it right first time. Following these 7 steps to software selection will help you make a good decision when choosing software for your small business! [5]
    <ol>
        <li>Know your objective.</li>
        <li>Create a list of software requirements.</li>
        <li>Start researching for relevent applications.</li>
        <li>start excluding solutions.</li>
        <li>Start trialling your selected software.</li>
        <li>Do your due diligence.</li>
        <li>Start negotiating.</li>
    </ol>
</p></div>
<div>
<h2>1.6. Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
<p>I have used many different technologies to achieve my goals, like Trello to help me organise my tasks and complete them in order. For the coding part of my project I used visual studio code which is a priority as it is used for the design and content for the website. I also used pages to keep notes of my answers to the questions that i researched using google and other websites. I used Github to save and upload my work so others can share it and update it, I use Github because it stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>1.7. Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h2>
<p>The Internet is a wonderful source of information and entertainment, but it’s important to realise that there are a number of restrictions on what you can and cannot do online.
    There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and videos. Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file can be copied or converted to another format. When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it. Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
    Legal constraints on online behaviour include protection of children legislation which prohibits grooming and inappropriate behaviour towards minors. You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended conduct of users in various online environments. Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or offline.
    You should always ensure that you observe the correct guidelines and procedures for safe use of the Internet. It is not sufficient to know about guidelines and procedures – you must apply these when you are online. [6]</p>

    <h1>unit 1, outcome 2.</h1></div>
    <div>
    <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h2>
    <p>The tools I have used to create my website have been crucial in developing it. For example, for the design and content of my project were created using visual studio code which makes it capable of being changed when I need to update it. Also by using Trello I can work at my own pace and it helps keep me organised and working to my schedule.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h2>
    <p> Without the tools I used to create my website I wouldn’t be as successful in my project for example, if I didn’t use GitHub I would have lost all my work. With trello I could keep up to date with my tasks and visual studio code is the main part of my project so these tools are appropriate. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h2>
    <p>My websites strength is that it is very easy to use and to read, also it is nice to look at. However I would like to use links and animations but since I am an amateur I still have a lot to learn. Overall I am happy with my website as it is my first work using new tools and I got to learn a lot so I’m exited to learn more.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
    <p>Improvements I would add to my website are more links and animations. Also I would like visitors to be able to jump across the page without scrolling and have the background picture scroll down with the user instead of being fixed and repeated.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
    <p>The purpose of my website is to show what I have learned and to answer questions. I believe my website has done this as it is eye-catching and full of information easy to understand but there are somethings about it I could have made better for example, I could add an animation in the background instead of the still image.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Unit 1, outcome 3.</h1>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
    <p>The benefits of using IT and systems is that it helps you find mistakes and identify problems, also it enables you to make gradual changes to maximise your productivity. However, rapid changes in technology can cause systems and tools can become outdated meaning you will need upgrades or replacements.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
    <p>There are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency like you could track and limit how much time you’re spending on projects and take regular breaks. Also you can quit multitasking as attempting to do several tasks at once can result in loss of time and productivity, instead just focus on one task at a time.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
    <p>Next time I start a project I will make full use of Trello to plan my project step by step and I will also give up on trying to make it perfect and do it to the best of my ability and make changes when necessary to improve it as I can always come back to it and adjust it.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
    <p>I would test digital solutions by comparing it to my previous work, also I could have a team member inspect the work and get a second opinion, I can also have testers check the project for bugs and other problems.</p>
