    <p>I joined codenation because I wanted to learn something new and useful. I am interested in making a career in IT because I needed a change from warehouse work and because I use technology everyday so this seemed like the right choice. Since joining I have learned a lot and it was difficult at first, but after a while you get used to it and you can create many wonderful things which I am very exited about doing.</p>
